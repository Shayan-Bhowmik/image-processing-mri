- Accuracy: 0.5833  
- Precision: 0.5833  
- Recall: 1.0000  
- F1 Score: 0.7368  

Confusion matrix showed that the model predicted only a single class (class 1) for all samples, indicating a critical issue in model behavior despite previously observed high training accuracy.  

This suggests potential problems such as class imbalance, data leakage during training, or incorrect evaluation setup, requiring further debugging and validation.

Improved evaluation results:
- Accuracy: 0.9996  
- Precision: 1.0000  
- Recall: 0.9993  
- F1 Score: 0.9996

  - Auto-load latest checkpoint from outputs/checkpoints
  - Selected Grad-CAM slice using highest tumor probability instead of max pixels
  - Added selection diagnostics in evaluation logs

  - False Positives: `2`
  - True Negatives: `194`
  - False Positive Rate: `0.0102`
  - Specificity: `0.9898`

### Files Modified / Added
- Modified:
  - `src/aggregation/topk_aggregation.py`
